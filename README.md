# battleship-TOP-project

I'll be honest. I have not finished the project yet, but at least some working version is ready. I almost understood the essence of the tests and why they are needed, but most of all I am stuck with the mocks and drag and drop. This issue will need to be dealt with in the future.

What have I learned: <br>
-Working with tests, what they are, why they are. Learned to use Jest.<br>

- Improved NPM skills.<br>
- Getting used to working with Webpack<br>
- Well, basic things like working with C SS and HTML.<br>

What else needs to be worked out:<br>
-Working with mocks. I think in the future it will be necessary to understand.<br>

- Well, Drag and Drop, it's also interesting how it works.<br>

  02.08.2022 - ver 1.0. Without Drag and Drop, only randomize function is working.
